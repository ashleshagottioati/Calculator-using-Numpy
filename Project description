### **Program Description**

This Python program is designed to compute various statistical measures from a fixed-size list of numbers. Specifically, it processes a list containing exactly **nine numerical values**, reshaping them into a **3×3 matrix** using NumPy. This approach allows for matrix-level operations and makes the computation of statistics more structured and meaningful.

Once the matrix is created, the program calculates six key statistical metrics:

1. **Mean** – The average of the values.
2. **Variance** – The measure of how far values spread from the mean.
3. **Standard Deviation** – The square root of the variance, showing the dispersion.
4. **Maximum** – The largest value.
5. **Minimum** – The smallest value.
6. **Sum** – The total of all values.

For each of these metrics, the program provides results in three perspectives:
- **Column-wise**: Statistics computed for each of the three columns.
- **Row-wise**: Statistics computed for each of the three rows.
- **Overall**: A single value computed over the entire 3×3 matrix.

To ensure clear understanding and usability, the program prints each result in a formatted, line-by-line output. This structure helps users easily interpret how data behaves across rows, columns, and the whole matrix.

The function also returns the results as a dictionary. Each key in the dictionary corresponds to a statistical measure, and the associated value is a list containing the column-wise, row-wise, and overall statistics. This makes the function reusable in other contexts where programmatic access to the results is needed—such as in data analysis workflows or automated reports.

Additionally, the program includes error handling to ensure the input list contains exactly nine elements. This protects against unexpected behaviors or incorrect assumptions in the reshaping process.

Overall, this program serves as a compact yet comprehensive tool for exploring matrix-based statistics using NumPy, and is ideal for learners and developers who want to deepen their understanding of numerical computing, array manipulation, and statistical analysis in Python.
