# Calculator-using-Numpy
This Python program takes a list of exactly nine numbers and reshapes it into a 3Ã—3 NumPy matrix. It then calculates key statistical measures: mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum.

Each of these metrics is computed in three ways:

Column-wise (for each column),

Row-wise (for each row),

Overall (for the entire matrix).

The results are printed in a clean, line-by-line format for easy readability. Additionally, the function returns the data in a dictionary format, making it useful for further processing or integration into other applications.

The code includes input validation to ensure that the list has exactly nine elements, avoiding reshaping errors. This program is ideal for practicing NumPy operations and understanding how to analyze data in matrix form using Python.
